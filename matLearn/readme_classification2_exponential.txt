A. Value-added Contributions

1) addBias: add a bias column to design matrix
In addition to implementing matLearn_ordinal_regression.m,  I fixed the model.addBias bug in matLearn_classification2_exponential.m
The original code would make model.addBias = 1, even when user set options.addBias = 0


B. Collaboration
